## Overview

Briefly describe the project, its objectives, and the deep learning models you are using.

*Models Using:*
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

## Dataset

- Link to the [Yelp Reviews dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).
- We are using the  - The json file "yelp_academic_dataset_review.json" for our purpose.

## Project Structure

Explain the directory structure of your project, highlighting important folders and files. Here's an example structure:

```plaintext
project-root/
│
├── data/
│   ├── yelp_dataset.json       # Downloaded Yelp dataset
│
├── models/
│   ├── supervised_model/       # Code and files related to the supervised model
│   ├── unsupervised_model/     # Code and files related to the unsupervised model
│
├── notebooks/
│   ├── supervised_model.ipynb  # Notebook for the supervised model
│   ├── unsupervised_model.ipynb # Notebook for the unsupervised model
│
├── README.md                   # This README file
```

## Dependencies

List the required dependencies and their installation steps (e.g., using `pip` or `conda`) in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Data Preprocessing

Explain how you preprocessed the Yelp dataset, including any data cleaning and feature engineering steps. You can reference the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook for details.

## Supervised Model

Describe the supervised deep learning model you implemented, its architecture, and how it's trained and evaluated. Reference the `supervised_model.ipynb` notebook for code and results.

## Unsupervised Model

Describe the unsupervised deep learning model you implemented, its architecture, and how it's used for analysis. Reference the `unsupervised_model.ipynb` notebook for code and results.

## Results

Summarize the results obtained from both models. Include metrics, visualizations, and any insights gained from the analysis.

## Future Work

Discuss potential improvements or extensions of the project, and what you plan to do in the future.

## How to Use

Provide instructions on how to run the code and notebooks in your project. Include any special considerations or configuration settings.

## License

Specify the license under which your project is shared (e.g., MIT License).

## Acknowledgments

Acknowledge any resources, libraries, or tools that you used in your project.

## Contact

Provide contact information for your group members for questions or collaboration.

Remember to keep your README file updated as your project progresses, and make it informative and well-organized for anyone who visits your repository.
